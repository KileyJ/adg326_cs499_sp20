This homework proved quite difficult for myself and the classmates I was working with. First, we had to figure out how to install both 
docker and deepstate, which involved us creating virtual machines. Ours kept running out of space, so we had to keep making new ones and
restarting the whole process over again. Eventually after a few days I got deepstate installed and working.

The library I found is for helping with the creation and management of data stuctures, in particular that of kdtrees. The library came
with one C and one Header file, simplyfying the process of compiling them. From here though, I was at a loss of what to do.
