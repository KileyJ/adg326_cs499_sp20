I wrote out the fuzzer for both afl and libfuzzer using the same library I used in homework assignment two. However, I am having quite a hard time figuring out how to get these to properly compile so I can fuzz the code. I still wanted to show myself using 4 different fuzzers, and am using the singular function I used in homework one to achieve this. I ran it on both afl with and without -d, and canâ€™t get the correct command prompt to run libfuzzer. However, I did write what I believe would be good fuzzers for the kdtree once getting past the current errors. Despite being close to the same runtime, the two runs have very different numbers of executions. Afl had 175.31 executions per second, while afl -d had 469.10 executions per second. The rest seems to be similar.
